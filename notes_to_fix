#import data from Freesurfer with patched verion
#Levamisol: only at T2, remove T1 from model Group_High_Low... and HP Levamisol
#do PCA after train test split, and seperate for train and test subset
#try removing T2 or T2 from dataset from HP cocaine
#make a loop to try out a set of n_neighbors (e.g. 1 to 26) to see what has the best accuracy performance
#drop variable to predict before running prediction
#do crossvalidation on linear regression model
#use lasso to select variables
#do confusion matrix and classification report
#do hyperparameter tuning
